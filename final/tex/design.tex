\section{System overview}

A block-diagram of the proof-of-concept system is illustrated in Figures \ref{fig:sensor_module_diagram} and \ref{fig:image_processor_diagram}. The system is separated into two parts: the sensor module (consisting of image sensor and encoder FPGA) and the image processor (with the appropriate decoder FPGA, flash storage and viewscreen).

The flow of data is from left to right and starts at the OV7670 image sensor. A sensor controller block connected to the image sensor configures the internal registers and then starts capturing image data at 30 frames-per-second. Each frame captured is stored in a central framebuffer which resides in off-chip DDR3 RAM on the sensor module board where it can be accessed by a DVI encoder which is constantly working in the background and taking each from to encode it for transmission. The sensor module and image processor boards are connected using a HDMI cable. It is important to note that while a HDMI connector is present on both boards, the pins can be driven to implement whatever custom interface is desired as they are attached directly to the \gls{fpga}.

Each frame that is transmitted over the link is received and decoded by the DVI decoder on the image processor board. Decoded frames are copied into a second framebuffer, again located in off-chip DDR3 RAM. If the shutter release button is pressed then the flash storage manager takes the frame currently residing in the framebuffer and writes it to the SD card. A VGA port on the image processor board can be connected to a viewscreen LCD for real-time image display.
