\chapter{Digital Video Interface}
\gls{dvi} is a video interface which surfaced in 1999. Designed by the \gls{ddwg} as a replacement for \gls{vga}, it was mainly used to display output from a computer's graphics adapter onto a monitor, although it did see some limited use in other entertainment equipment such as TVs and DVD players.
